# Welcome to 3UM's Atomic SDK

This component library is built following the atomic design principles. Our components are developed based on these rules and can be easily installed from npm.

## About Atomic Design

Atomic design is a methodology for creating design systems. There are five distinct levels in atomic design:

1. **Atoms**: Basic building blocks of matter, such as buttons, inputs, or text labels.
2. **Molecules**: Groups of atoms bonded together to form a functional unit.
3. **Organisms**: Groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.
4. **Templates**: Page-level objects that place components into a layout.
5. **Pages**: Specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real content.

## Getting Started
